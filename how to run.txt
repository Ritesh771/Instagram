To set the IP address for the expogo project (specifically for connecting to the backend API), you need to update the hardcoded base URL in the API service file. The backend is currently running on 0.0.0.0:8000 (listening on all interfaces), so you'll use your machine's local IP address (e.g., something like 192.168.1.100:8000).

Where to Change It
Edit the file api.ts ( inside the expogo folder )  and update the API_BASE_URL constant on line 32:

You can find your local IP by running ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (macOS/Linux) in a terminal
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000/api';
the Expo app on a physical device, ensure the device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your backend server.
